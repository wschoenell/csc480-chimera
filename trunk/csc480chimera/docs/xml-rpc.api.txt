Chimera XML-RPC Interface
====================

The Chimera XML-RPC controller exports the following methods:

Chimera.isAlive () -> boolean
Chimera.getListOf (String  className) -> String[]

all classes extending ChimeraObject could be used as 'className', so Chimera.getListOf("Camera")
 will return a list, possibly empy, of all 'Camera' objects currently running on the system.
 The names returned will be of the form ClassName.instance_name, like 'Camera.st7'.
 This name should be used as a base name to actualy request actions from a given object.

To call the isExposing method of a Camera object name st7, request Chimera.st7.isExposing with a 
valid list of parameters, in this case a empty list.

The default port of the XML-RPC server is 7667. The general form of the URL is http://IP_OR_NAME:7667/RPC2.
