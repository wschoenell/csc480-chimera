To use the interface you would have to import chimeradb.py 

---> To import chimeradb.py you would have to write
   " from chimera.util.database import chimeradb " and also "import MySQLdb"

---> After successfully importing you can create object by calling constructor 
      mydb = database()[constructor]

---> After successfully creating a database object you can use different methods to accomplish different tasks.
